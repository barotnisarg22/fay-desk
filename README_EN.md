Floating window mode allows you to enjoy dynamic wallpapers while conveniently engaging in interactive conversations, achieving a perfect blend of work and entertainment.

### 🎨 Dynamic Wallpapers

The application includes a built-in dynamic wallpaper resource library. All wallpapers are implemented using HTML5 technology. You can easily switch wallpapers with simple operations, or import custom wallpaper packages to create your exclusive desktop environment.

### 🫧 Digital Avatar

Based on Xmov embodied driving technology, digital human avatars are integrated into the desktop experience. With simple configuration, you can connect to the service. The digital human generates corresponding expressions and lip-sync in real-time based on conversation content, creating an authentic face-to-face communication experience.

Thanks to Xmov's cloud rendering capabilities, complex digital human rendering calculations don't need to be performed locally. Therefore, even devices with lower configurations can enjoy smooth, high-definition digital human interaction experiences without worrying about local hardware performance limitations.

### 🎯 System Integration

Deeply integrated with operating system functions, providing global hotkey support. You can quickly wake up the application or open floating window mode in any scenario.
